# The Pirates' CS35L Project

This is the repository for our Fall 2022 CS35L project. The code for the
frontend is located in `client/` and the code for the backend is located in
`server/`. 

## Setup

Running `npm i` or `npm install` in the top level directory will install
dependencies for both the server and client. 

## Building and Running

To run the application, first the code for the frontend must be built. To do so,
run `npm start` in the top level directory. This will build the React.js project
in `client/` and copy the result into the required folder in `server`, and then
start the server.

## Development Server

To run the application in development mode, where the server and client will
autorefresh when files are changed, run `npm run dev` from the top level
directory.
